1.
A. Write and execute a C++ Program to display names, roll no’s, and grades of 3 students who have appeared in the examination. Create a class with data members as Name, Roll no and Marks
for 3 subjects. Write a method to calculate the grade. Read and display the contents of an array using pointer to array of objects. NOTE: All the methods for a class need to be defined
outside the class.
B. Write and execute a C++ program to create a class called 'COMPLEX' to hold a complex number. Include a friend function to add and multiply two complex numbers.

2.
A. Given that an EMPLOYEE class contains following members: data members: Employee number, Employee name, Basic, DA, IT, Net Salary .Write and execute a C++ program to read the data of N
employee and compute Net salary of each employee (DA=52% of Basic and Income Tax (IT) =30% of the gross salary) using array of objects. NOTE: All the methods for a class need to be defined
outside the class
B. Write and execute C++ Program to find whether the given number is Armstrong Number or not.

3.
A. Write a C++ program to create a class and overload pre-increment and post increment operator for user-defined objects.
B. Write and execute a C++ program to create a class called 'TIME' that has - three integer data members for hours, minutes and seconds - constructor to initialize the object to zero -
constructor to initialize the object to some constant value - member function to add two TIME objects - member function to display time in HH:MM:SS format. Write a main function to create
two TIME objects, add them and display the result in HH:MM:SS format.

4.
A. Write and execute a C++ program to implement bubble sort using class template.
B. Create a C++ class that includes constructors to do the following.
i) Create an uninitialized string. 
ii) Initialize an object with a string constant at the time of creation. 
iii) Create an object and initialize with another object. Also write a function to concatenate two strings.

5.
A. Write and execute a C++ program to create a class called STUDENT with data members Usn, Name and Age. Using inheritance, create the classes UGSTUDENT and PGSTUDENT having fields as 
Semester, Fees and Stipend. Enter the data for at least 3 students. Find the semester wise average age for all UG and PG students.
B. Write and execute a C++ program to calculate volume of a BOX and Static member function getCount( ) that returns the total number of objects after creating object.

6.
A. Write and execute a C++ program to implement the following inheritance. Assume suitable data members and member functions for all the classes. Display the number of publications for
a teacher and read three test marks in student class and display the percentage marks for a student in marks class.
TEACHER <-------PERSON --------> STUDENT ---------->MARKS
B.Write and execute a C++ program to illustrate the order of execution of constructor and destructors using multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance.

7. Write and execute a C++ program to solve the diamond problem. Suppose we have 2 classes B and C that derive from the same class A. We also have class D that derives from both B and
C by using multiple inheritances.

8. Write and execute a C++ program to print the size of a file using C++ manipulators.

9. Write and execute a C++ program to perform operations on list using STL to
i. Insert an Element at the front and at the End
ii. Delete the Element at the front and at the End
iii. Size of the List
iv. Remove Elements with Specific Values & duplicate values
v. Reverse the order of elements
vi. Merge & display Sorted Lists

10. Write and execute a C++ program to implement stack with necessary exception handling.

11. Write and execute a C++ program that creates a binary file to hold student records. Read the data from the terminal which consists of Roll no., Name (a string of 30 or lesser no. of
characters) and total marks for 3 subjects. Compute the grade and append it to the student record and display the complete record on terminal by reading the data from binary file.

12. Write a C++ program having student as an abstract class and create many derived classes such as Engineering, Science, medical etc. From the student class. Create their objects and
process them.

13. Write and execute a C++ Program to find the Number of Lines in a Text File.

14. Write and execute a C++ program to demonstrate the use of multiple try and catch blocks. Also demonstrate the re-throwing of the caught exceptions.

15. Write and execute a C++ program to consider a Bookshop which sells both book and video tapes, create a class known as MEDIA that stores the Title and Price of publication then create
two derived class, one for storing the number of pages in a book and another for storing the play time of the tape using the concept of pure virtual function and passing parameters to base class
constructor.

16. Write and execute a C++ program using STL to
i.Insert an element into the vector
ii.Delete the last element from the vector
iii.Display the Size of vector
iv.Display the elements in vector
v.Clear the vector

17. Write and execute a C++ program to Append the Content of a File at the end of another file.

18. Write and execute a C++ program using STL to
i.Insert an Element into the Map
ii.Delete the Element from the Map
iii.Find Element at a key in a Map
iv.Display value of an Element at a specific key HOD, Dept. of CSE
v.Size of the Map
vi.Display by using iterator

19. Write and execute a C++ program to read a paragraph from a text file and find the count of the vowels individually for each of the a, e, i, o and u for both the cases (Uppercase &
Lowercase). Display the Count of the vowels individually and position at which they are found in another file.
